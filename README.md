Waterlily is a game engine/toolkit built for pixelart, tile-based RPG games. It's built to be very performant and yet extremely simple to use. It relies on no wrapper libraries, instead preferring to go straight for the backends ([Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) and [X11](https://www.x.org/wiki/) instead of [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), etc.).

----------

#### Versioning
Waterlily follows semantic versioning. The version number is detailed in the [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt) file, within the initial "[project](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/project.html)" command.
